### About Me :

I'm a student programmer interested in quantum computing and AI alignment.

This is my [portfolio](https://hyu9.vercel.app/), where you can see my projects and what I'm currently working on.

- 📋 Currently in school.

- 🔎 I'm currently reading through a few research papers regarding AI alignment:
  - [Scaling Monosemanticity](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/)

- ✉️ Contacts are on the top.

List of my most recently completed projects:
- [Quantum Computing and ML for DFT Calculations in Proteins](https://hyu9.vercel.app/projects/quantum-computing-and-ml-for-dft-calculations-in-proteins)
- [Music Generation Using GGAs](https://hyu9.vercel.app/projects/music-generation-using-ggas-(old))
- [Analysis of Noise on Quantum Models](https://hyu9.vercel.app/projects/analysis-of-noise-on-quantum-models)
- [Understanding the Influence of Qubit Features on Error Rates](https://hyu9.vercel.app/projects/understanding-the-influence-of-qubit-features-on-error-rates)
